June 18th, 1815: Napoleon's Grand Armee faced a coalition of British and German armies led by Generals Wellington and Blucher just south of Brussels near a town called Waterloo, bringing an end to both the 100 Days Campaign and the Napoleonic Era. I visited Brussels to see the battlefield of Waterloo for the 202nd Anniversary, in addition to get a little taste of Belge culture.

Brussels is a multilingual city filled with a mix of 19th century Parisian style apartment blocks, Gothic churches, Wood Flemish-style houses and sleek glass-and-steel compounds housing both EU diplomats and the constellation of lobbyist associations that are the modern day courtiers of Brussels. The current seat of central government for the European Union, Brussels has historically been at the center of major trade routes in Northern Europe and during the 15th and 16th centuries was intentionally expanded through efforts at draining the nearby swamplands - called 'Bruxelles' in the dialect of French at the time. 

My usual modus operandi in a new city is to walk around at random until I find some cool stuff, then search it up on wikipedia, in a kind of self-guided walking tour. This went pretty well in Brussels, as the first road I picked took me to the "Grand Place" or Grote Markt, the central square of old-town Brussels surrounded by opulent guildhalls, and the palatial city hall and across from it, the "House of Barons."

Since it was after dark, the square - all 68 by 110 meters of it - was filled with groups of adolescents and adults alike, drinking wine from the bottle and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. It seemed a lively and jovial kind of scene, so I walked further into the city and watched some breakdance troupe, then joined a pub crawl as it descended into Delirium, the name of a below-ground bar which serves up a hearty 10% brew.

Brussels has, by the way, some beautiful architecture, which I'll just dump here as a few photos to whet the appetite.

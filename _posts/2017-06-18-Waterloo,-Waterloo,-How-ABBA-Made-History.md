The night before the Battle of Waterloo it was raining hard, a wet and dreary Saturday that soaked the mud and flooded the fields of the small town of Waterloo just south of Brussels. It seemed a rather inauspicious night, after hard fighting for several days prior, the crowded armies of Europe stuck to their encampments, waiting to see which army would claim mastery of all Europe. Indeed, much as it was the rainy Saturday of the 1974 Eurovision song contest finale, after fierce competition from the European contestants in the crowded seaside resort town of Brighton, UK, where the continent eagerly awaited Europe's next proclaimed singing champion.


While rain kept Eurovision song contest viewers glued to their television sets, eagerly awaiting the finale showdown between Europe's greatest musical talents, some 159 years previous a similar torrential downpour mired Napoleon's cannons in the mud, slowing his advance against the English position at Waterloo to a grinding halt.

Napoleon was in hot pursuit of Wellington, having split the English and Prussian armies the day previous at the battle of Quatre-Bras, forcing Wellington to retreat northwards, digging in behind a ridge just south of a town called Waterloo. Blucher led the Prussian army in a controlled retreat along a parallel route North, pursued by [Marshal of France, Emmanuel de Grouchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_de_Grouchy,_marquis_de_Grouchy) and seeking to link up with the English before re-engaging with the French forces.

Soggy conditions on the battlefield prevented French artillery from taking up offensive positions against the English until mid-afternoon, but rain alone didn't slow Swedish-Norwegian foursome of **A**gnetha Fältskog, **B**jörn Ulvaeus, **B**enny Andersson, and **A**nni-Frid Lyngstad (**ABBA**) from stealing the hearts of all Europe that rainy April evening. Waterloo would prove to be a watershed moment, a contest whose outcome would influence the course of both musical and geopolitical developments on the European continent for decades to come.

Indeed, the meteoric rise of ABBA bandmembers through the scandinavian pop culture of the 1960s closely parallels Napoleon's own early career. Agnetha Faltskog, independently recording and writing a number one hit at the age of 18 after being discovered by a music producer released a number of bombshells that blew away her competition in the Scandinavian pop scene, while Napoleon himself rose from promising young artillery officer to the rank of general by age 24. Both gained their positions of influence and power during revolutionary times - Agnetha, during the explosive era of disco's transformative impact on the dance and nightlife scene of western society; Napoleon, during the equally influential French Revolution which established the modern conception of human rights and equality in the eyes of the law. 


Social forces which in hindsight seemed inevitable often take the established order by surprise, and neither Swedish disco-pop nor Revolutionary equality, fraternity, liberty were exceptions. In both cases, ABBA and Napoleon Bonaparte swept the mainland countries of Europe and her colonies with terrifying speed and success. One was a conscripted army, mustered in desperation to save a struggling nationalist revolutionary state; the other, four upbeat disco-pop Swedish Superstars spreading the good cheer of Golden Age Capitalism from post-war Europe to a growing international audience of peace-loving hippies. Both used conventional tactics but in bold new ways, innovating a new generation of standards and tactics. And both have influence felt long after their demise - the Napoleonic Code; Mamma Mia; the Metric System; ABBA Christmas Special.

In contrast to previous Eurovisison winner's post-contest careers, ABBA's campaign of 1977 was of an entirely different nature - concert-hardened veterans having performing for the past 4 years for live audiences, ABBA swept the Western European Cities of Copenhagen, Berlin, Cologne, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Essen, Hanover, Hamburg, even crossing the channel and taking Manchester and London by surprise. Indeed, ABBA swept through all the major countries of the Napoleonic Coalitionary wars, taking with stunning surprise and rapidity regions which had cost Napoleon tens of thousands of troops and munitions. 

Both Napoleons Revolutionary Grand Armee and the tetrad of swedish superstars made drastic innovations in standards of fashion and dress for their time. Napoleons troops, considered among the best dressed in Europe, demonstrated powerfully that a meritocratic republic could hoist from so-called 'scum of the earth' - commoners - fit regiments that could best any in Europe. Meanwhile, in 1970s Sweden, owing to a stipulation in tax law the cost of clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances, creating a glamorous and sequin-festooned image that made lasting impressions in both audience's minds and the 8mm Technicolor film used at the time. In both cases a trend of showmanship, of dressy flair and immaculate appearances was established as the new norm for professional standing armies and pop groups alike. 

While for one, Waterloo marked the beginning of a meteoric rise to lasting infamy and power, for the other, Waterloo was the end of just such a rise. One day dawns, another sets, separated in time by a mere 159 years that bridges those rainy Saturdays where it all began. Signing the formal declaration of surrender shortly thereafter, Napoleon was quoted as having remarked:

*Alors, comment pourrais-je refuser;
J'ai l'impression de gagner quand je perds*

*So how could I ever refuse; 
I feel like I win when I lose*

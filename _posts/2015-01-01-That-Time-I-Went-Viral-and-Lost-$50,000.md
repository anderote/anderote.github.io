# Publishing and Ownership in the Digital Age, or, how I lost $50,000 US

A few years ago I was very active in publishing answers on a website called [Quora](www.quora.com), which is like Yahoo Answers on steroids (although, bereft of [Ken M's magical presence](http://gizmodo.com/ken-m-is-the-most-epic-troll-on-the-internet-1739028329)). During this time I was basically in my 'science infancy' - devouring wikipedia articles, watching various documentaries, reading journal articles and the like, but all without really grinding myself into the deep-and-dirty mathematics that is the engine of modern physics. 

In brief, it was probably the most creative I'll get with scientific knowledge for the next few years - sometime after **Mount Stupid** (see image), where I liked to write long essays on how the expanding universe creates time and consciousness, but before I began to doubt my ability to add numbers when doing vector calculus in Electromagnetism.

A couple of these answers blew up pretty big, and for reasons I don't fully understand. I suppose its because they are the kind of 'IFL' Science tidbits that are easily digestible while ruminating on the porcelain throne, the kind that make you go 'gee whiz sure is a wonderful world' in between quickmatches in Call of Duty 15: UltraViolet Ops 3. 

Here's a copy of the [original answer](https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-world-lost-oxygen-for-5-seconds) (which has clickable links to 'sources') to the question, "What would happen if Oxygen Disappeared for 5 seconds?"

> ### All Oxygen? A few things..

> - Everyone at the beach would get sunburns. Ozone is molecular oxygen, and blocks the majority of UV light. Without it we are toast.
> - The day-time sky would get darker. With fewer particles in the atmosphere to scatter blue light, the sky would get a bit less blue and a bit more black.
> - Every internal combustion engine would stall. This means that every airplane taking off from a runway would likely crash to the ground, while planes in flight could glide for some time.
> - All pieces of untreated metal would instantly spot weld to each other. This is one of the more interesting side effects. The reason metals don't weld on contact is they are coated in a layer of oxidation. In vacuum conditions, metal welds without any intermediate liquid phase (Cold welding). 
> - Everyone's inner ear would explode. As mentioned, we would lose about 21% of the air pressure in an instant (~ from sea level to 2000m elevation), so expect some serious hearing loss.
> - Every building made out of concrete would turn to dust. Oxygen is an important binder in concrete structures (really, the CO2 is), and without it the compounds do not hold their rigidity. 
> - Every living cell would explode in a haze of hydrogen gas. Water is 88.8% oxygen; without it the hydrogen turns into gaseous state and expands in volume. Molecular weight of Water
> - The oceans would evaporate and bleed into space. As oxygen disappears from the oceans' water, the hydrogen component becomes an unbound free gas. Hydrogen gas, being the lightest, will rise to the upper troposphere and slowly bleed into space through Atmospheric escape.
> - Everything above ground would immediately go into free fall. As oxygen makes up about ~45% of the Earth's crust and mantle, there is suddenly a lot less "stuff" beneath your feet to hold everything up.

> To sum, it wouldn't be pretty.

## The Reception

At first I was pretty flattered people upvoted it on the website Quora. It was a nice ego-boost during a particularly dark winter in Norway (turns out, every winter is dark there). When I found out it was going to be published in [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/03/19/what_would_happen_if_oxygen_were_to_disappear_for_5_seconds.html), I was even happier. Then, even a bit giddy when a more reputable [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/what-would-happen-if-oxygen-disappeared-for-five-seconds-8925756.html) newspaper in the UK asked me to publish it too. Both companies had tie-ins with the website Quora, and gave me credit with a little picture of me on a good hair day.

Sensing internet dollars around the corner, I decided to write a cute followup about ["what would happen if oxygen doubled?"](https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-the-amount-of-oxygen-in-Earths-atmosphere-was-doubled-instantly). This wasn't as popular on Quora, nobody asked to use it, so I figured that was that. 

Until about a year later, when in a sour mood I, like Schopenhaur, decided to hunt up evidence of my own fame and found a video on YouTube that took both my Quora answers, added in some fade-in fade-out photos of beaches and airplanes, and [reached over 10 millions views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXEjJSALaCU). TheChive.com, and other sites like it, had also done similar things and copy/pasted my text without giving any credit, and reached fairly sizable audiences. 

## The Lesson...?

The real lesson here was the answers I had actually invested time into writing on Quora, things that are deep and philosophical and meaningful wherein I did research and actually cited sources - these went utterly unnoticed. Instead, a list of bulletpoint tidbit 'factoids' I basically made-up (most of which are wrong) became popular.

And when it became popular, people started to steal it. And profit from it. And profit they did - according to [somewhat unreliable estimates](https://www.quora.com/How-much-money-do-people-make-from-YouTube-videos-with-1-million-views) a million views on YouTube might be worth anywhere from $1200 to $9000, with some saying $5000 USD is a reasonable number. Well, this video had 10 million views, which would've netted me a nice $50,000 USD. You're welcome, BuzzFeed.

# Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

I am reading my way through [Meditations](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html) by [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius), and it's profound for how simple, straightforward, clear and insightful his writing is. Thanks should also be given to the translators, who took the work from Latin, but simplicity of his writing and the plainness of the truth he speaks really levels me sometime.

Here is a favorite quote, from book Two statement 14
>Even if you're going to live three thousand more years, or ten times that, remenber: you cannot lose another life than the one you're living now, or live another one than the one you're losing. The longest amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. 

> For you can't lose either the past or the future, how could you lose what you don't have?

Another, from book two:

> Don't ever forget these things: the nature of the world, my nature, how i relate to the world, what proportion of it I make up, that you are part of nature, and no one can prevent you from speaking and acting in harmony with it, always.

Marcus writes in absolutes often, but they are simple statements that are impossible to argue with. The truth is self-evident most of the time. But sometimes, he makes finer distinctions, for exampe:

> "In comparing sins Theophrastus says that the ones committed out of desire are worse than those out of anger; which is good philosophy. The angry man seems to turn his back on reason out of a kind of pain and inner covulsions. But the man motivated by desire, who is mastered by pleasure, seems somehow more self-indulgent, less manly in his sins... The Angry man is more like a victim of wrongdoing, provoked by pain to anger. The other man rushes into wrongdoing on his own, moved to action by desire."

It would be easy to go on quoting Marcus, Meditations is replete with memorable aphorisms and bold statements of simple truths. What strikes me as powerful about his thoughts is how piercing they are in a modern context: we are surrounded by distractions, an incessant stream of social media notifications, comparisons to one another, eager to follow trends and each other, we so often look outside ourselves for guidance and direction. There is a sharp sense of economic survival imbued in our need to stay abreast of news - how to capitalize on trends, which business is growing or failing, where the jobs will be in 5 years. But likewise, so much of 'news' is simply clutter, social trivia that impels itself on our attention with its false claim to urgency; an urgency I believe we inculcate by giving in to a fear of missing out. 

Rather than follow a hundred different celebrities, scroll through endless news feeds, Marcus encourages us to "[not] waste the rest of your timei here worrying about other people - unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You'll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they're saying... and all other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind" (III, 4). Again, its difficult not to quote Marcus at length, I'm sure one could write a piercing and artful essay using only his quotations strung together. 

It is easy to give in to demands for our attention, and every business vies for it. It is so much harder, but more crucial, to clear away the clutter of things beyond ourselves and focus on our minds, our nature, our role in the world. It is intimidating to acknowledge mortality and the threat of oblivion the scientific view of death might imply, but to ignore it and consume our limited time with distractions, unclear thinking, to react to circumstances as animals do - impulsive, emotional, without reflection - is to give up the hope of enlightenment. Marcus speaks of the **logos**, or animating spirit of rationality, as the ultimate focus of our attention. And I think to a large part he's right - we empathize with acts of passion, and in that way they move us. But to see the world clearly, and plainly, and not shy away from ideas like death or impermanence, requires more than passion can provide.

 **Logos** is not the detachment of a dispassionate observer, as some stoics might seem (like Epictetus, to paraphrase, "What harm can be done to me by the murder of my wife and child, so long as I act virtuous?"), but the acknowledgement of a context that supercedes the individual. That there is tragedy and suffering, and pleasure and delight, but these are not all there is in the world worthy of our attention, and to distinguish ourselves from animals is to feel these things but not be controlled by them. Instead, to "concentrate every minute like a Roman, on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions."

One of the most significant take-homes of Meditations isn't just the simple truths it so boldly states, but to recognize who it was that said them. Marcus Aurelius was Roman Emporer during its height of power - essentially, unquestioned ruler of almost the entire known civilized world. This is not the cognitive dissonance of one who can't afford worldly pleasures, and so eschews them, but the perspective of a truly enlightened mind and, I think, one who was truly free in spirit and at peace with themselves and their mortality.

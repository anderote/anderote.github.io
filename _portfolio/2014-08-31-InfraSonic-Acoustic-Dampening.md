# Damping Room Modes for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy

## Background

STM Low vibration environment - mention the exponential relationship between tunneling current and distance of a mono-atomic tip

equation: exponential decay of tunneling current

## Problem

Ambient infrasonic sound waves, describe room modes and diffraction around objects

## Solution

Rayleigh theory of viscuous damping and diffusion of sound energy. Dampening at both SPL maximum and velocity maximum. Low density fibreglass best for low frequency sound, volume is important. 

## Process

construction of large amount of low density foam blocks, covered in acoustically transparent cloth

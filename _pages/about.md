I'm a Vancouverite with a big interest in physics and math. I'm a fan of all-you-can-eat sushi, hanging with dogs, literature, people-watching and waterskiing. Writing is a big hobby of mine, which motivates a lot of the posts in this website.  

I'm also an [Engineering Physics student](http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) at UBC, specializing in Electrical Engineering with Minors in Honors Mathematics and also Entrepreneurship. While in the EngPhys undergrad degree I've enjoyed working in [applied physics](http://lair.phas.ubc.ca/) and [electrical engineering](http://rsl.ece.ubc.ca/about.html), have done data science in Jupyter (aka iPython) Notebooks for [Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca/), and in a different line of work reserch on community engagement and environmental sustainibility for infrastructure development projects with the [Engineering Leadership Council](engleadership.org/).

Most of my 'big career interests' are centered around high-powered, big budget physics experiments that preferably use terms like "Megawatts" and "Kiloamps," and involve large stainless steel vacuume chambers that do magic-y physics things with ridiculous speed and precision. I was quite excited, then, in 2017 to take on a position at [TRIUMF Cyclotron](http://www.triumf.ca/) in their RF Engineering department, where I developed a [High-Voltage Transformer for a novel accelerating structure](http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2017/papers/thpik003.pdf).

Last summer in 2017, in a change of pace from my career interest in big-budget physics, I did a stint at the [Techincal University of Berlin](http://www.control.tu-berlin.de/Welcome) building a C++/Python Gait Analysis toolchain that helps Physicians diagnose and treat walking disorders. 

Currently I'm employed at [General Fusion](http://generalfusion.com/) in their Plasma Engineering department, helping develop their prototype Magnetized Fusion Reactor, which involves using terms like "Megawatt" and "Kiloamp" quite regularly. 

Before I had my own website I spent a bit of time writing answers on the website Quora, which you can see [here](https://www.quora.com/profile/Andrew-Cote).
